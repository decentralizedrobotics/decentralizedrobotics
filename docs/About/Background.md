# About

[Ranch Hand Robotics](http://youtube.com/@rh_robotics) provides education materials, developer tooling and solutions for Outdoor Robotics. Decentralized Robotics was built out of a need to use robots on a homestead - a place where blanketing the property with Wifi is not feasible and cell coverage is non-existent. 

I'd like to thank the developers and communities of the following projects for their work which has made this project possible:

* [Open Robotics Foundation](https://www.openrobotics.org/foundation)
* [Libp2p Project](https://libp2p.io/)
