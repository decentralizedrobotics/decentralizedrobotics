This work is shared by Lou of a [Polyhobbyist](http://youtube.com/@polyhobbyist). It was built out of a desire to use robots on my homestead - a place where blanketing the property with Wifi is not feasible and cell coverage is non-existant. I've found that others have similar situations and have been looking for a solution - so I share this work freely.

This work builds on the work of others, and I am grateful for their contributions. I hope that this work will be useful to others and that they will contribute back to the project.
